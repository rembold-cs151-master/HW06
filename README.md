Assignment Status: PENDING

_Please change the above to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

Due the night of March 6 at midnight!


## Instructions
The homework pdf has the basic instructions, and you should definitely read the docstrings, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Make sure you remember to upload a pdf again on this assignment, as Problem 1 has written work.
 - [ ] Read through the docstrings before getting started! They have important information!
 - [ ] Create a recursive image in `Prob2.py`. Make sure to include the requirements listed in the pdf!
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob3.py` to find and output prime factors.

__Remember to fill out the commented metadata at the top of each Python script!__

#### Testing
 - Prob 2
 	- No tests for this!
 - Prob 3
 	- Automated tests will check all template functions
