    Function which returns True if a number is prime and False otherwise.

    Function which returns all prime factors of a number in the form of a tuple.

    Inputs:
        - num (int): the integer number for which the prime factors are desired
    Outputs:
        - (tuple of ints): tuple list of all the prime factors. If factors appear multiple times
                   they should show up in the list multiple times.
